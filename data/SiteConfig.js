  userDescription: `Hi there, I am Victor, people call me basket, I played drums in this band and loved every minute of it.
  Razorbacks is no longer active and it is very unlikely that we return in the near future. I work as a software developer and in order 
  to stay up to date with new tech trends I build sites to try out new nerdy shit. This is my first try with gatsby.js, netlify and netlify-cms 
  which are all awesome. I will be gathering as much band related material (albums, pictures, videos) as I can and will be posting it here
  as well as whatever else that goes through my mind. I never had a blog so this may end up being my personal blog disguised as a band page lol.
  Anyways, thats enough text, I was feeling dirty leaving the default template user description. kthxbye.`, // User description to display in the author segment.
  // Links to social profiles/projects you want to display in the author segment/navigation bar.
