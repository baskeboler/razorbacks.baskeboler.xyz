## wtf?

We shot this video one afternoon in Porto Alegre while on tour at Dundi's (from Yesomar) house where we were staying. Sergio Caldas, from Motor City Madness, a band we were sharing stage with that night, made the decision of shooting/editing/directing the video. The guy knows his shit so we were in good hands. We had a blast shooting it.
